        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "- Interpreted languages execute code line-by-line (like Python), while compiled languages convert code to machine language before execution (like C++). Interpreted languages are easier to debug, but compiled ones often run faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "- Exception handling lets you manage errors in a clean way using try, except, and other blocks. It prevents your program from crashing unexpectedly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "- The finally block runs no matter what—whether an error occurred or not. It's often used for cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "- Logging is used to record messages that describe events in a program. It helps with debugging and monitoring without using print statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __del__ method is a destructor that gets called when an object is deleted. It’s used to free resources, though relying on it too much isn’t recommended.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "- import module loads the whole module, while from module import name imports specific parts. The second one gives direct access to what you need.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "- You can use multiple except blocks for different exceptions or a single except with a tuple of exceptions. It helps you catch and handle various errors neatly.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "- The with statement automatically closes the file after its block ends. It’s a safer and cleaner way to handle files without forgetting to close them.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "- Multithreading runs threads in the same process, sharing memory, while multiprocessing runs separate processes. Multiprocessing avoids the GIL and is better for CPU-heavy tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "- Logging helps track what’s happening in your program over time. It’s flexible, configurable, and more professional than print statements for debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "- Python manages memory using automatic garbage collection, reference counting, and memory pools. It helps prevent memory leaks and keeps things efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "- Use a try block to write risky code, except to catch errors, else for success, and finally for cleanup. These blocks work together to handle issues safely.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "- Good memory management ensures programs run efficiently and don’t consume too much memory, which can slow things down or crash your app.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "- try lets you test code for errors, and except lets you handle those errors gracefully. It's a structured way to avoid crashing your program.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "- Python uses reference counting and a garbage collector to remove unused objects automatically. It keeps your program from running out of memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "- The else block runs only if no exception was raised in the try. It’s useful for code that should run after successful execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "- The main logging levels are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. They help categorize the importance of log messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "- os.fork() creates a new process in Unix systems, but it's low-level. The multiprocessing module is cross-platform and easier to use for process management.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "- Closing a file frees up system resources and ensures data is written correctly. It’s essential for clean and safe file handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "- read() reads the whole file at once, while readline() reads one line at a time. Use readline() for memory efficiency in large files.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "- The logging module records events and errors in a program. It helps track issues and maintain logs for analysis or debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "- The os module lets you work with file paths, directories, and system operations like deleting, moving, or renaming files.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "- Challenges include circular references and unexpected memory retention. Manual cleanup is sometimes needed for long-running or large-scale programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "- Use the raise keyword with an exception type. For example: raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\").\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "- Multithreading is useful for I/O-bound tasks like file access or web requests. It improves performance by doing multiple things at once.\n",
